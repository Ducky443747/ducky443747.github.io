welcome to my gamesite, this is still a work in progress unfortunately. I know that I shouldn't be working on this before finishing my google sites but I am.
MASSIVE CREDIT TO 3kh0 for lots of these games and giving me hours of fun in school (before it was blocked). like my google sites, dont expect this to be super high quality like 3kh0, i'm still learning github pages. Also, if this gets blocked I truly don't know what i'm going to do, maybe make another website or something? Incase this site gets blocked keep the old google sites bookmarked and use the internet glitch to get by to see the new link.

If you would like to help me develop this site, first off, thank you! It takes a lot of time to make this site. Second off, contact me (via email on contact page), tell me who you are, and why you would like to help (also tell me if you know how to code or are willing to learn). And thats it! Its somewhat easy to get my acceptance.
