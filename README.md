# welcome to my gamesite, this is still a work in progress unfortunately. I know that I shouldn't be working on this before finishing my google sites but I am.
MASSIVE CREDIT TO 3kh0 for lots of these games and giving me hours of fun in school (before it was blocked).
 like my google sites, dont expect this to be super high quality like 3kh0, i'm still learning github pages.
Also, if this gets blocked I truly don't know what i'm going to do, maybe make another website or something? Incase this site gets blocked keep the old google sites bookmarked and use the internet glitch to get by to see the new link.
edit: guys im worried, i don't know how to rip html5 games and I don't want it all to be from 3kh0 because I don't wanna completely rely on his hard work.
