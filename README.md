For my friends who were watching to see when I would finish this site, my school has banned all games, and I don't really want to get caught. The consequences that may befall me scare me. Maybe I will continue work on this site, but I will have a lot less time to work on this due to other stuff.

I am back to working on the site! This time, I won't be using githubs built in themes, and I will code a "theme" myself. I sometimes work on this during school, where I don't have vs code, so there will be some buttons on the WIP (work in progress) homepage that will lead to a blank themed thing with some games. I might link some other game sites to use while this is in progress too. Hopefully people use this over cool math games but I would understand if people don't. I'll edit this post sometime soon, maybe when I have a lot more progress on the site. 

Also, please vote on the theme colors for the new "theme". It will probably have a dark mode, and when I do make a dark mode, it will be selected by default. I will make a light theme for you sociopaths who actually want to use light mode themes.

If you would like to help me develop this site, first off, thank you! It takes a lot of time to make this site. Second off, contact me (via email on contact page), tell me who you are, and why you would like to help (also tell me if you know how to code and what language or if you are willing to learn). And thats it! Its somewhat easy to get my acceptance.
